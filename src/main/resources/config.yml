# TopVoter Config
# Votes are tracked and reset on 'reset-day'. The plugin checks if it's reset day every time it starts up
# Placeholders: %topvoter_spot_<spot>% returns the players name,
# %topvoter_spot<spot>_votes% returns the amount of votes they have in the month so far
# %topvoter_get_<name>%, returns the amount of votes the player has in the month so far
# %topvoter_get%, returns the amount of votes the provided player has in the month so far

# The day of the month the plugin should reset votes it's tracked
# Set to a negative number if you never want it to reset, and you just want to record votes/reset manually
reset-day: -1

# The message printed to console after reset
reset-log: "It's the first of the month! Votes have been reset!"

# Message for when a spot has not been filled and a placeholder tries to call it
empty-spot: "No one!"
